            <p>You arrive to the Cougar Country club in a honda civic with a vanity plate that says “CATSRPPL”. You’re wearing
                a moo-moo. It looks a little like this… You are Agnes Martin. 73 years old. You own thirteen cats each named after a famous Female Diva. You only brought one companion to the cougar country club however, your oldest cat Aretha Franklmittens. Aretha unfortunately has ovarian cancer so you’ve decided to bring her along so she 
                can live a little before she dies…fairly soon.
